# Sports-Hub Application .NET Back-End

## Project Description

This is a draft pet project for testing Generative AI on different software engineering tasks. It is planned to evolve and grow over time. Specifically, this repo will be a .NET playground.

The application's legend is based on the sports-hub application description from the following repo: [Sports-Hub](https://github.com/dark-side/sports-hub).

## Available Front-End applications
- [Angular](https://github.com/dark-side/sports_hub_angular_skeleton)
- [React.js](https://github.com/dark-side/sports_hub_react_skeleton)

## Dependencies

- Docker
- Docker Compose

The mentioned dependencies can be installed using the official documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
[Podman](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/compose) can be used as an alternative to Docker.

## Setup and Running the Application

### Clone the Repositories

To run the web application with the React front-end, clone the following repositories within the same folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dark-side/sports_hub_net_skeleton.git
git clone https://github.com/dark-side/sports_hub_angular_skeleton.git
```

### Run Docker Compose

Navigate to the back-end application directory and run (`-d` for detached mode to run in the background):

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

### Attach to the Backend Container

Run `docker ps` and copy the `backend` application container ID. Then, connect to the container with the following command:

```sh
docker exec -ti <CONTAINER ID> /bin/bash
```

### Database migrations

Migrations are automatically applied on application start.

### Running on Windows (Tips & Tricks)

While running the App on Windows 11 using WSL, you may face issues related to Unix-style line endings (especially if you are storing the project(s) under the host machine filesystem, not the WSL one (e.g., the project is cloned to the disc `c:` or any other disk you have instead of being cloned to the WSL filesystem). Working within the WSL filesystem is a best practice when developing on Windows, as it helps prevent line ending and permission issues that can arise when using the Windows filesystem. I'm just reminding you that this will save you time and headaches for future projects.

If you are still reading this, please ensure your host machine converts related script(s) to Unix-style line endings.
```sh
# Install dos2unix if not already installed
sudo apt-get install dos2unix

# Convert all files in the project directory to Unix-style line endings
find . -type f -exec dos2unix {} \;

# Convert one file (example)
dos2unix app/appsettings.json
```
Also, if you face issues with `bin` directory files not being executable, you can fix it with the following commands:
```sh
# check current permissions on the file
ls -l app/SportsHub.Api

# ensure the file is executable
chmod +x app/SportsHub.Api
```

### Accessing the Application
To access the application in a browser locally, open the following URL:
- Mac, Linux - `http://localhost:3000/`
- Windows - `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`
